        <p>Originated in Saint Petersburg, we operate distributed work-threads to practice world-building in collective carpentry.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Think of the personal experience happening to us;</li>
            <li>Process it accordingly to the collective training capacity and personal goals;</li>
            <li>Let other spectators get agency by improving their morale towards "being means-to-itself".</li>
        </ul>
